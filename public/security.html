    <h1>Security Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 01.01.2026</p>

    <p>
      MVP HOUSE LTD (“we”, “us”, “our”) is committed to maintaining a secure environment for all users of our SaaS platforms,
      micro-SaaS tools, and AI-driven products (“Services”). This Security Policy outlines the technical and organisational
      measures we implement to protect personal data and system integrity.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Security Principles</h2>
    <p>Our security framework is based on the following principles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong> — Preventing unauthorized access.</li>
      <li><strong>Integrity</strong> — Preventing unauthorized changes.</li>
      <li><strong>Availability</strong> — Ensuring continuous and reliable access.</li>
      <li><strong>Resilience</strong> — Preparing for and recovering from incidents.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>2. Data Encryption</h2>

    <h3>2.1 In Transit</h3>
    <p>All data transmitted between users and our systems is encrypted using HTTPS with TLS 1.2+.</p>

    <h3>2.2 At Rest</h3>
    <p>Sensitive data stored in our systems is protected using encryption provided by hosting partners such as DigitalOcean or Vercel.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>3. Access Control</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced across internal systems.</li>
      <li>Administrative access is restricted to essential personnel only.</li>
      <li>Strong password requirements are enforced internally.</li>
      <li>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is used where available.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>4. Infrastructure &amp; Network Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Hosting infrastructure is provided by trusted cloud partners such as Vercel, DigitalOcean, and Cloudflare.</li>
      <li>Firewalls, network isolation, and endpoint protection are enforced.</li>
      <li>DDoS protection is in place via Cloudflare’s global network.</li>
      <li>Regular security patches and updates are applied to systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>5. Application Security</h2>
    <p>We apply industry-standard security practices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Secure coding standards</li>
      <li>Regular dependency and library updates</li>
      <li>Automated vulnerability scanning</li>
      <li>Regular internal security reviews</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>6. AI Security &amp; Data Handling</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>AI prompts and outputs are processed securely and transmitted only to approved AI providers.</li>
      <li>AI data is <strong>not</strong> used to train underlying models.</li>
      <li>AI outputs may be cached temporarily to improve performance, but not for user tracking.</li>
      <li>We prohibit the submission of sensitive or special category data unless contractually agreed.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>7. Monitoring &amp; Logging</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>System performance and uptime are continuously monitored.</li>
      <li>Logs are maintained for security analysis and debugging purposes.</li>
      <li>Suspicious activity may lead to additional monitoring or access restrictions.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>8. Backups &amp; Disaster Recovery</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Automated backups are performed regularly for critical systems.</li>
      <li>Backup data is encrypted and stored in secure environments.</li>
      <li>Disaster recovery procedures ensure service continuity.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>9. Incident Response</h2>
    <p>We have processes in place to respond rapidly to security incidents, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Immediate containment and investigation</li>
      <li>Root-cause analysis</li>
      <li>Mitigation and patching</li>
      <li>Notification to affected users where required</li>
      <li>Regulatory reporting where legally obligated</li>
    </ul>
