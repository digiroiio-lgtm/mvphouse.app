    <h1>Fair Use Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 01.01.2026</p>

    <p>
      This Fair Use Policy (“FUP”) explains the limits of acceptable usage for SaaS platforms, micro-SaaS tools, AI-based services,
      and APIs (“Services”) operated by MVP HOUSE LTD (“we”, “us”, “our”).<br />
      The purpose of this Policy is to ensure stable, reliable, and fair access for all users.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Scope</h2>
    <p>This Policy applies to all users, accounts, and automated systems accessing or using our Services, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Subscription-based plans</li>
      <li>Free and trial accounts</li>
      <li>API access and integrations</li>
      <li>AI-powered tools and features</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>2. General Fair Use Principles</h2>
    <p>Users must not use the Services in a way that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Degrades performance or availability for other users.</li>
      <li>Creates unreasonable or disproportionate load on our infrastructure.</li>
      <li>Circumvents technical, contractual, or rate-limit restrictions.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>3. AI &amp; Resource Usage Limits</h2>
    <p>We may apply soft or hard limits on resource usage, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Number of API requests per minute, hour, or day.</li>
      <li>Total AI prompt tokens or generations per billing period.</li>
      <li>Number of concurrent jobs, tasks, or background processes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Plan-specific limits are typically described on the pricing page or within your account dashboard.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>4. Prohibited Usage Patterns</h2>
    <p>The following behaviours are considered unfair or abusive use of the Services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Running continuous automated scripts solely to consume resources.</li>
      <li>Attempting to bypass or manipulate rate limits or usage caps.</li>
      <li>Sharing a single user account across unrelated organisations or large groups.</li>
      <li>Using free or trial plans as a substitute for paid, high-volume usage.</li>
      <li>Programmatically creating large numbers of accounts to avoid charges.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>5. API and Automation Limits</h2>
    <p>Where API access is provided, you must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Respect the published rate limits.</li>
      <li>Implement appropriate backoff and retry strategies.</li>
      <li>Not expose your API keys publicly or to unauthorized parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>6. Consequences of Breach</h2>
    <p>If we determine that your usage violates this Fair Use Policy, we may take one or more of the following actions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Temporarily throttle or limit your access.</li>
      <li>Contact you to propose an appropriate higher plan or custom agreement.</li>
      <li>Suspend or terminate your account for repeated or severe violations.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>7. Business &amp; Enterprise Plans</h2>
    <p>Business or enterprise users with higher or custom limits may be exempt from certain default thresholds, as explicitly agreed in written contracts or order forms.</p>
