    <h1>Billing &amp; Subscription Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 01.01.2026</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This Billing &amp; Subscription Policy explains how billing, renewals, pricing, and cancellations
      operate across all MVP HOUSE LTD (“we”, “us”, “our”) SaaS and micro-SaaS products. By purchasing or
      using any subscription, you agree to these terms.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Payment Processor</h2>
    <p>All payments are securely processed by Stripe. We do not store or access your full card information at any time.</p>

    <h2>3. Subscription Renewals</h2>
    <p>
      All subscriptions renew automatically at the end of each billing cycle unless cancelled beforehand.
      The renewal charge will be applied to the payment method on file.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Pricing and Changes</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify pricing. Users will be notified at least <strong>7 days</strong> before any pricing change takes effect.</p>

    <h2>5. Free Trials</h2>
    <p>
      If a plan includes a free trial, no charges will be applied until the trial period ends. To avoid charges,
      cancel before the trial expiration. Once the trial converts to a paid plan, billing will follow the standard
      subscription cycle.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Billing Cycles</h2>
    <p>
      Subscriptions may be billed monthly, quarterly, annually, or via custom enterprise terms. The billing
      frequency is specified during checkout.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Failed Payments</h2>
    <p>
      If a payment fails, Stripe will automatically attempt to process the charge again.<br />
      If the payment method continues to fail:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your account may be temporarily suspended.</li>
      <li>You will receive notification to update your payment method.</li>
      <li>Loss of access continues until successful payment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Cancellations</h2>
    <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time through your user dashboard or by contacting us at <strong>support@mvphouse.app</strong>.</p>
    <p>Cancellation applies only to future billing cycles. We do not issue refunds for the remaining time in the current billing period.</p>

    <h2>9. One-Time Purchases</h2>
    <p>Some products may be offered as a one-time payment. These products do not renew and are non-refundable once purchased and delivered.</p>

    <h2>10. Taxes</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, VAT or applicable taxes may be added to the total amount charged.</p>

    <h2>11. Chargebacks</h2>
    <p>
      Any chargeback filed without contacting us first may result in account suspension.<br />
      We encourage users to reach out for support before initiating bank disputes.
    </p>
